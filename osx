# Enable Stealth mode
# Computer hackers scan networks so they can attempt to identify computers to attack. You can prevent your computer from responding to some of these scans by using stealth mode.
# When stealth mode is enabled, your computer does not respond to ICMP ping requests, and does not answer to connection attempts from a closed TCP or UDP port.
# This makes it more difficult for attackers to find your computer.

# Applications that are signed by a valid certificate authority are automatically added to the list of allowed apps, rather than prompting the user to authorize them.
# Apps included in OS X are signed by Apple and are allowed to receive incoming connections when this setting is enabled. For example, since iTunes is already signed by Apple,
# it is automatically allowed to receive incoming connections through the firewall.
#
# If you run an unsigned app that is not listed in the firewall list, a dialog appears with options to Allow or Deny connections for the app.
# If you choose Allow, OS X signs the application and automatically adds it to the firewall list.
# If you choose Deny, OS X adds it to the list but denies incoming connections intended for this app.
